# About The Project
Ever wondered where the gender-neutral bathrooms are at McGill? Did you know McGill has a menstrual health project providing hygiene products in select bathrooms?
Have you ever wished for more privacy when using a restroom? Or needed to know which buildings offer physically accessible bathrooms?
Maybe you didnâ€™t have time to shower and need to find one on campus?

Introducing **BathroomBreak**!
An interactive map designed to help you locate bathrooms that meet your specific needs. With BathroomBreak, you can:
- Find gender-neutral bathrooms by building and floor.
- Identify physically accessible bathrooms and their locations.
- Locate showers available on campus.
- Check which bathrooms are stocked with menstrual health products.

Our simple and intuitive UI lets you filter bathrooms based on your preferences and explore what each building offers.
Plus, you can leave reviews for others to share your experiences and highlight the best bathrooms on campus!
