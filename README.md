# About The Project
Ever wondered where the gender-neutral bathrooms are at McGill? Did you know McGill has a menstrual health project providing hygiene products in select bathrooms?
Have you ever wished for more privacy when using a restroom? Or needed to know which buildings offer physically accessible bathrooms?
Maybe you didnâ€™t have time to shower and need to find one on campus?

Introducing **BathroomBreak**!
An interactive map designed to help you locate bathrooms that meet your specific needs. With BathroomBreak, you can:
- Find gender-neutral bathrooms by building and floor.
- Identify physically accessible bathrooms and their locations.
- Locate showers available on campus.
- Check which bathrooms are stocked with menstrual health products.

Our simple and intuitive UI lets you filter bathrooms based on your preferences and explore what each building offers.
